            I heard she sang a good song, I heard she had a style<br/>
            And so I came to see her and listen for a while<br/>
            And there she was this young girl, a stranger to my eyes<br/>
        </br>
            Strumming my pain with her fingers<br/>
            Singing my life with her words<br/>
            Killing me softly with her song<br/>
            Killing me softly with her song<br/>
            Telling my whole life with her words<br/>
            Killing me softly with her song<br/>
        </br>
            I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd<br/>
            I felt she found my letters and read each one out loud<br/>
            I prayed that she would finish but she just kept right on<br/>
        </br>
            Strumming my pain with her fingers<br/>
            Singing my life with her words<br/>
            Killing me softly with her song<br/>
            Killing me softly with her song<br/>
            Telling my whole life with her words<br/>
            Killing me softly with her song<br/>
        </br>
            She sang as if she knew me in all my dark despair<br/>
            And then she looked right through me as if I wasn't there<br/>
            But she was there the stranger, singing clear and strong<br/>
        </br>
            Strumming my pain with her fingers<br/>
            Singing my life with her words<br/>
            Killing me softly with her song<br/>
            Killing me softly with her song<br/>
            Telling my whole life with her words<br/>
            Killing me softly with her song<br/>
