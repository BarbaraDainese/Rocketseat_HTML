    <P>
        I heard she sang a good song, I heard she had a style<br/>
        And so I came to see her and listen for a while<br/>
        And there she was this young girl, a stranger to my eyes<br/>
    </P>

    <p>
        Strumming my pain with her fingers<br/>
        Singing my life with her words<br/>
        Killing me softly with her song<br/>
        Killing me softly with her song<br/>
        Telling my whole life with her words<br/>
        Killing me softly with her song<br/>
    </p>


    <p>
        I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd<br/>
        I felt she found my letters and read each one out loud<br/>
        I prayed that she would finish but she just kept right on<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        Strumming my pain with her fingers<br/>
        Singing my life with her words<br/>
        Killing me softly with her song<br/>
        Killing me softly with her song<br/>
        Telling my whole life with her words<br/>
        Killing me softly with her song<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        She sang as if she knew me in all my dark despair<br/>
        And then she looked right through me as if I wasn't there<br/>
        But she was there the stranger, singing clear and strong<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        Strumming my pain with her fingers<br/>
        Singing my life with her words<br/>
        Killing me softly with her song<br/>
        Killing me softly with her song<br/>
        Telling my whole life with her words<br/>
        Killing me softly with her song<br/>
    </P>
